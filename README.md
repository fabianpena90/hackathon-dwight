# hackathon-dwight
This was a project created in 2.5 hours with another web dev and 3 UX/UI designers in our hackathon.

We won the challenge by creating a website for one of the characters from The Office, we chose 
Dwight Schrute and created a classic looking website from the early 90's.

Feel free to take a look at the final product.
